## Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Used the Canvas API to create a star field in JS and HTML

**Thoughts:** I was afraid that I may not know enough JavaScript to pull this off but I think accepting it and be willing to learn it, helped me accomplish this today.

**Link to work:** [GitHub repo](https://github.com/krithvi/krithvi.github.io) -> commits = {'Add Star Field'}

**References:** [Medium Article on creating a star field](https://medium.com/better-programming/fun-with-html-canvas-lets-create-a-star-field-a46b0fed5002)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
